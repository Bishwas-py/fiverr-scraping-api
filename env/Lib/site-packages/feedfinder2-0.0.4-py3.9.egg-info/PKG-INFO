Description: Feedfinder2
        ===========
        
        This is a Python library for finding links feeds on a website. It is based on
        `feedfinder <http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/feedfinder/>`_ - originally
        written by `Mark
        Pilgrim <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Pilgrim_(software_developer)>`_ and
        subsequently maintained by `Aaron
        Swartz <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz>`_ until his untimely death.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Feedfinder2 offers a single public function: ``find_feeds``. You would use it
        as follows:
        
        ::
        
            from feedfinder2 import find_feeds
            feeds = find_feeds("xkcd.com")
        
        Now, ``feeds`` is the list: ``['http://xkcd.com/atom.xml',
        'http://xkcd.com/rss.xml']``. There is some attempt made to rank feeds from
        best candidate to worst but... well... you never know.
